description: An idiosyncratic, highly original writer who is credited with developing
  the genre of psychological horror, Oliver Onions also tried his hand at science
  fiction, steering clear of the obvious ""little green men"" approach and opting
  instead for a style far more subtle and engaging. In The Tower of Oblivion, the
  narrator befriends a fellow scribe whose life has taken a bizarre turn. What's the
  truth behind his shocking secret? Read The Tower of Oblivion to find out.
